Convert OpenVPN configuration files to ONC configuration files.

## How to use
Download the `index.html` file and open it in Chrome (or any other modern browser). Follow the instructions there.

You can also use the hosted copy at [https://onc.arcticfoxes.net](https://onc.tommytran.io). If you do, you need to trust the website (hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.app/)) to not exfiltrate your password, certificates, and keys.
